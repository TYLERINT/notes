# Questions and clarifications

## Timesheet Assistant by Sweets

### 1. Clarification:  

In my _app.js_, I see the follow snippet of code:

`await doc.useServiceAccountAuth(require('./google-sheets-credentials.json')); `

Does this just search the whole project folder for the API credentials?

### 2. Why does the jovo debugger sometimes say "Not Connected", even when I've just run `jovo run` while in my project folder? 

<br/>

### 3. What's supposed to happen after the intro plays ("Welcome welcome welcome!")?
